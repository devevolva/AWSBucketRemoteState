# S3 REMOTE STATE WITH DYNAMO DB LOCKING:
## Terraform remote state using AWS S3 with state locking using AWS DynamoDB.


When applying for the first time, run Infrastructure/Main.tf first to build
out the resources needed for applying Main.tf in the root folder which builds  
out the backend and webserver test example.


The aws_instance "amiWebServer" example in Main.tf in root is unsecured and 
is only provided to test backend configuration. It is meant to be replaced 
before deployment to a prodcution environment and should not be left running 
unattended.
